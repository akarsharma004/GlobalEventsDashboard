# Global Event Exploration and Dashboard

## Project Overview:

This project delves into the world's most significant events, extracting key insights and presenting them in a visually compelling format.

## Data Sources:
* Data is collected from alcedata which gives information about the event type, location, fatalities, civilian targeted etc.

## Tools Use:
* **postgresql** is used for exploring the data
* Findings are presented in **Power BI** dashboard.

## Data Exploration(Findings):
* SQL is used to explore over 1M events across the globe. Following are the insights:
  * Protests emerged as the most frequent event type, accounting for a staggering 410,000 occurrences. However, they also came with the highest number of fatalities, highlighting the often-violent nature of these demonstrations despite most of being peaceful protests.
  * While events occurred throughout the year, October stood out as the most turbulent month. This suggests seasonal factors or specific events might influence global unrest patterns.
  * The data revealed a disturbing trend: events targeting civilians saw the highest occurrence, highlighting the vulnerability of innocent people caught in the crossfire.
  * When it comes to regional impact, Europe and the Middle East emerged as hotspots, with each experiencing over 200,000 events. This underscores the complex geopolitical dynamics at play in these regions.
  * At the country level, Ukraine and Myanmar emerged as epicenters of unrest, recording 150,000 and 75,000 events respectively. Understanding the specific contexts behind these numbers is crucial for informed analysis.  
    
## Dashboard:
* This Power BI dashboard tracks worldwide events, showing the total number, fatalities, and civilian involvement.
* Explore how different types of events trend across months, revealing patterns and potential causes.
* Distribution of these events and there types.
* Identify which regions and countries are most affected by different types of events using the interactive map visualization.
